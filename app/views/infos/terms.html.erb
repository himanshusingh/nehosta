If a Guest requests a booking of your Accommodation and stays at your Accommodation, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Nehosta is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Nehosta serves as the limited authorized agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting payments from Guests on behalf of the Host and is responsible for transmitting such payments to the Host.

	The fees displayed in each Listing are comprised of the Accommodation Fees (defined below) and the Guest Fees (defined below.) The Accommodation Fees, the Guest Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”.

Please note that it is the Host and not Nehosta which determines the Accommodation Fees.

	Appointment of Nehosta as Payment Agent for Host
	Each Host hereby appoints Nehosta as the Host’s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting payments made by Guests on behalf of the Host.

In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Host, Nehosta assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Host.
	Please note that Nehosta does not currently charge fees for the creation of Listings.

Please note that Nehosta will provide notice of any Listing fee collection via the Site, prior to implementing such a Listing fee feature.

	Bookings and Financial Terms for Guests
	The Hosts, not Nehosta, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Accommodations reserved through the Site. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of an Accommodation, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Accommodation imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Nehosta, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Nehosta is not a party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Nehosta disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.

Upon your payment of amounts to Nehosta which are due to the Host, your payment obligation to the Host for such amounts is extinguished, and Nehosta is responsible for remitting such amounts, less Nehosta’s Host Fees, to the Host. In the event that Nehosta does not remit any such amounts to a Host, such Host will have recourse only against Nehosta.
	Listings for Accommodations will specify the Total Fees. As noted above, the Host is required to either confirm or reject the booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Nehosta in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Host), any amounts collected by Nehosta will be refunded to such Guest, depending on the selections the Guest makes via the Site and any pre-authorization of such Guest’s credit card will be released, if applicable.
